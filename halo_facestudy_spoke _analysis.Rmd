for the actual analyses we want
1- learn spatiotemporal structure suing NMF
2 - does drug vs no drug differ in NMF metrics?
3- can we separate groups based on NMF components using BADIA

spatiotemporal dynamics
- movement substates (initiation, sustainment, etc)
- if we use kmean clustering, do we have differences into how many substaes are there
- or if we use a fixed number of substates, are there significant temporal differences (e.g. duration, recurrence)

preferences
