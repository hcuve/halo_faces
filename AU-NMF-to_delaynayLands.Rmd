we need to map AUs to facial landmarks

Steps
1. Compute correlation between all landmarks (focus just on y coordinate and AU activation)
- this will tells about which Y is active when a specific AU is present (but we have multiple combinations, what do we do with ) ultimately this should be regression or correlation and should be computed fro all the dataset - so it will be like a pre-trained modeld
2 - Compute PCA or NMF of AUS
3 - Recreate the AU patterns from PCA or NMF model
4 - Based on reconstruct AU patterns colour landmarks with the average AU activation that matches each pattern

- this needs to be validate with a dataset where AUS single AUs are produced
